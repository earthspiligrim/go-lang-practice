Why Golang?

Go is relatively young open-source programming language. Google designed it to meet the needs of developers working on large-scale projects. Although it incorporates
concepts from other languages like C, Go has unique features in terms of application development capabilities. 

It is majorly objectified towards creating servers and backend systems, but as a general-purpose programming language, you can do anything with Go.

Go is very powerful when it comes to concurrency. It is easier to create applications that effectively utilize modern multi-core and networked machines while keeping neat modular programming code (eg: using of the multi cores to regulate the go routines)

Go is perfect for web development with its smart library, steady performance, solid security, and clean syntax.
